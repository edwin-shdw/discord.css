# About
This repository contains a stylesheet looking like Discords default style. It is ideal for styling preview
components like modals, inputs or user cards. You can use the bundled CSS file or import the styles
to your custom SASS Stylesheet. Get a preview [here](https://edwin-shdw.de/projects/discord.css/preview/).
