Discord uses a tag like styling for users, members, channels and roles which got mentioned. Each uses blurple as a color
and is therefore the default for this class.

<CodePreview>
    <Mention>@Username</Mention> <Mention>@Member name</Mention> <Mention># general</Mention>
</CodePreview>

```html
<span class="dc-mention">@Username</span>
<span class="dc-mention">@Member name</span>
<span class="dc-mention"># general</span>
```


Roles on the other hand will get the color of the mentioned role. You can provide the color using the
`--dc-mention-color` CSS variable.

<CodePreview>
    <Mention role color='#f47fff'>
        @Server Booster
    </Mention>
</CodePreview>

```html
<span class="dc-mention dc-mention-role" style="--dc-mention-color: 244, 127, 255">
    @Server Booster
</span>
```

Role mentions will increase their opacity on hover, that's why you will need to pass the rgb values to the
`--dc-mention-color` variable. If you are using a frontend framework like [React](https://react.dev/) you could simply
define a function which returns the rgb values of a color.

```js
function hexToRgb(hex) {
  if(hex[0] === '#') hex = hex.slice(1);
  let bigint = parseInt(hex, 16);
  let r = (bigint >> 16) & 255;
  let g = (bigint >> 8) & 255;
  let b = bigint & 255;

  return r + ", " + g + ", " + b;
}
```
