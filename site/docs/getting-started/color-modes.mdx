# Color modes

discord.css provides seamless support for both **dark mode** and **light mode**, with dark mode enabled by default. You can customize the color mode of your components or your entire website using simple attributes and selectors.

## Setting the Color Mode

To switch color modes, apply the `data-dc-theme` attribute to an element. Use either `light` or `dark` as the value. All discord.css components within that element will adopt the specified color mode.

For example, applying `data-dc-theme` to the `<html>` or `<body>` element will set the color mode for the entire website:

```html
<html lang="en" data-dc-theme="light">
  <!-- The entire page will use the light theme -->
</html>
```

If a nested element also has a `data-dc-theme` attribute, it will overwrite the color mode of its parent. This allows for granular control of color modes within specific sections of your page:

```html
<body data-dc-theme="dark">
  <div>
    <!-- This section uses dark mode -->
    <section data-dc-theme="light">
      <!-- This nested section uses light mode -->
    </section>
  </div>
</body>
```

## Customizing Theme Selector
discord.css allows you to integrate with your own theme selectors. You can define custom selectors for light and dark modes by configuring them in your SCSS setup:

```scss
@use '/node_modules/discord.css/scss' with (
    $light-theme-selector: '[data-theme="light"]',
    $dark-theme-selector: '[data-theme="dark"]',
);
```

## Using Multiple Selectors
If you have multiple theme selectors, you can combine them using commas. For example:

```scss
@use '/node_modules/discord.css/scss' with (
    $light-theme-selector: '[data-theme="light"], [data-color-scheme="bright"]',
);
```
