# Set up a font

Discord uses the `gg sans` font which is currently not an open-source font. Therefore, discord.css doesn't ship any
font out of the box and will inherit the font by default. However, we found two possible open source alternatives which
seem to fit pretty well:

- `Hanken Grotesk` ([view on Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Hanken+Grotesk))
- `Work Sans` ([view on Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans))

:::info
The demo components in this documentation uses the `Hanken Grotesk` font.

You can also stick to one of Discords fallback fonts:

- `gg sans`
- `Noto Sans`
- `Helvetica Neue`
- `Helvetica`
- `Arial`
- `sans-serif`
- `Apple Symbols`


## Include your font

### With CSS
You can set your font by either changing the `--dc-base-font` variable in the discord.css file or by overwriting it in
your own css file.
```css
:root {
    --dc-base-font: 'My custom font', sans-serif;
}
```

### With SASS
If you use SASS you can specify the font when importing the package.

```scss
@use '/node_modules/discord.css/scss' with ($font: '"Hanken Grotesk Variable", sans-serif');

// or for component-based usage:
@use '/node_modules/discord.css/scss/variables' with ($font: '"Hanken Grotesk Variable", sans-serif');
```
