# Introduction

Learn how to include Discord.css in your project.

## Package managers

Using Discord.css with a package manager brings some advantages like customizing the prefix or only including needed
components which will reduce the compiled CSS file.

Discord.css uses [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) as it's preprocessor so make sure to install it as well.

```
npm i discord.css
npm i --save-dev sass
```
