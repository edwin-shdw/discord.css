# Introduction

Learn how to include Discord.css in your project.

## Compiled CSS

Download ready-to-use compiled code for Discord.css to easily drop it into your project, which includes:

- Compiled CSS
- Compiled and minified CSS

Each version comes with a CSS source map.


<Button as='a' variant='blurple' href={`https://github.com/edwin-shdw/discord.css/releases/tag/v${Package.version}`} target="_blank">Download</Button>


## CDN

If you don't want to download the file you can use [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/discord.css).

<pre><code>
    {`<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/discord.css@${Package.version}/dist/css/discord.min.css">`}
</code></pre>

:::tip
You should use [Subresource Integrity (SRI)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity)
when using CDNs! You can find the SRI for Discord.css on [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/discord.css).

## Package managers

Using Discord.css with a package manager brings some advantages like customizing the prefix or only including needed
components which will reduce the compiled CSS file.

Discord.css uses [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) as its preprocessor so make sure to install it as well.

```
npm i discord.css
npm i --save-dev sass
```
