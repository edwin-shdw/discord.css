# Setup SASS

You have two options for importing discord.css's:

- [Import all of discord.css](#import-all-of-discordcss)
- [Import only the components you need](#import-components)


## Import all of discord.css

```scss
@use "/node_modules/discord.css/scss";

// Then add additional custom code here
```


## Import components

If you want to use only parts, you will need to import the `root` file as most of the components rely on the css
variables generated in this file.

```scss
// 1. First include root
@use "/node_modules/discord.css/scss/root";

// 2. Then include the components you need
@use "/node_modules/discord.css/scss/button";
@use "/node_modules/discord.css/scss/embed";
@use "/node_modules/discord.css/scss/message";
// ...

// 3. Then add additional custom code here
```


## Prefix

To avoid collision with your own codebase discord.css uses a prefix. This prefix will be applied to all css variables as
well as all class names.

By default, the prefix is set to `dc-` (note the trailing dash). You can change it by loading the module with a
configuration. Here's an example using `fn-` as prefix:
```scss
@use "/node_modules/discord.css/scss" with ($prefix: "fn-");
```

If you are loading parts of discord.css you will need to load the `variables` module instead.
```scss
@use "/node_modules/discord.css/scss/variables" with ($prefix: "fn-");
```

:::warning
You must load the `variables` module **before** any other discord.css module.
